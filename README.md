# Macropad Hotkeys With Extension Support

This is a modified version of the OG [Hotkeys](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys) script from Adafruit. This script allows you to define custom functions to override the main loop to create your own functionalities. Currently, this repo includes a Pomodoro timer and a Bongo Cat thingy as extentions.

## Included Extensions

- Pomodoro Timer
- Bongo Cat (Based off of [this repo](https://github.com/christanaka/circuitpython-bongo))
